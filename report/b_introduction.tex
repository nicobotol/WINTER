\section{Structure of the work and limitation of the scope}

\textcolor{red}{REWRITE EVERYTHING}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivation and scope for the thesis
    \item Use of a reference turbine for benchmarking the results
    \item Presentation of the structure of the thesis and its different chapters
\end{itemize}


The scope of the thesis is the development of an emulator of a large size wind turbine and its use for the development of its controllers.\\

Since it is necessary to validate and cross-check the obtained results during the development of the work, then the DTU 10 MW Offshore Wind Reference Turbine will be used as benchmark.\\

The structure of the work is here presented.\\

\subsection{Limitation of scope}\label{sec:limitation_of_scope}
write here what it is not considered in the thesis because it is not relevant or because it is out of the scope of the thesis itself
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vibration induced by the rotor on the tower
    \item Coupling with the waves in case of offshore deployment
    \item Grid interface and grid regulations
\end{itemize}

Dopo aver riletto tutta la tesi, cercare di formulare due tre domande tecniche che potrebbero essere quelle a cui la tesi cerca di rispondere, che dovrebbero in qualche modo conincidere con gli obbiettivi stessi. Nella parte di conclusione poi bisogner√† in qualche modo dare una risposta a queste.
