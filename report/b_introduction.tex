The scope of the thesis is the development of an emulator of a large size wind turbine and its use for the development of its controllers.\\

Since it is necessary to validate and cross-check the obtained results during the development of the work, then the DTU 10 MW Offshore Wind Reference Turbine will be used as benchmark.\\

The structure of the work is here presented.\\

\subsection{Limitation of scope}\label{sec:limitation_of_scope}
write here what it is not considered in the thesis because it is not relevant or because it is out of the scope of the thesis itself
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vibration induced by the rotor on the tower
    \item Gain scheduling for the pitch controller
\end{itemize}
