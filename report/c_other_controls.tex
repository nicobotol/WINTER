\section{Turbine control base on model-free methods}\label{sec:control_P_GE}
The control methods developed so far relays on the knowledge of the system model and the also the environmental parameters such as the air density. In fact in the calculation of the gains $K_{opt}$ and $K_{opt,GE}$ a single value of $c_P$ and $\rho$ has been used assuming that them do not change in time, for example due to aging of the system or evolution of the air's temperature and pressure. In order to take these quantities into account,
