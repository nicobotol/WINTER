\subsection{Wind speed generation}
In this section, the generation of a realistic \acrshort{WS} time series is addressed. This problem in general may take into account both time and spatial-dependent aspects, such as turbulence, wind shear, presence of the tower and possibly of other WTs in the neighborhood. Starting from the easy things, only the turbulence effect will be initially considered, following what is proposed by \cite{Aerodynamics_of_wind_turbines}. \\
Calling $\Delta_t$ $\left[\si{\second}\right]$ the time between two following measurements of an anemometer working at a sample frequency of $f_s$ $\left[\si{\hertz}\right]$, the number of samples collected in the total observation time T $\left[\si{\second}\right]$ is N. The lowest frequency that can be resolved is called $f_{low}=1/T$ $\left[\si{\hertz}\right]$. \\
Assuming the signal to be periodic, it can be decomposed using the \acrfull{DFT}. On the other way around, once the \acrfull{PSD} is known then the inverse \acrshort{DFT} can be used to generate a wind series with desired characteristics. One possible analytical expression for a \acrshort{PSD} is the so called Kaimal spectrum:
\begin{equation}
    PSD(f) = \frac{I^2V_{10}l}{\left(1+1.5\frac{f \ l}{V_{10}}\right)^{5/3}} \ \ \mesunt{\square \meter \per \second}
    \label{eq:PSD}
\end{equation}
where $I=\sigma/V_{10}$ is the turbulence intensity, $\sigma$ is the wind standard deviation $\left[\si{\meter\per\second}\right]$, $f$ is the frequency $\left[\si{\hertz}\right]$, $V_{10}$ is the 10 minutes average wind speed, $l$ is the length scale (said $h \ \left[\si{\meter}\right]$ the height above ground, $l=20h$ for $h<30 \ \left[\si{\meter}\right]$, and  $l=600 \ \left[\si{\meter}\right]$ otherwise).\\
A wind series that fulfils the prescribed \acrshort{PSD} is:
\begin{gather}
    u(t) = \bar{u}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sqrt{\frac{2PSD(f_n)}{T}}\cos{(\omega_nt-\varphi_n)} \ \ \left[\si{\meter \per \second}\right]
    \label{eq:wind_series}
\end{gather}
with $t = i\Delta_t$ for $i=1,\dots,N$ and $\varphi$ randomly generated in $ \left[0, 2\pi\right]$ $\left[\si{\radian}\right]$. \\
An example of generated wind series for $V_{10}=10 \ \mesunt{\meter\per\second}$ with turbulence of $\sigma_{V_{10}}=1 \ \mesunt{\meter\per\second}$, height above ground of $h=150 
 \ \mesunt{\meter}$, and for a time horizon of $T = 300 \ \mesunt{\second}$ is reported in \autoref{fig:wind_generation}. As a cross-check of the results, the same figure reports also the expected mean (i.e. $V_{10}$) and two horizontal reference lines at $V_{10}\pm3\sigma_{V_{10}}$ which is the interval where the 99\% of the generated data are expected to be. Furthermore, the PSD of the generated signal is computed and plotted alongside the one used in the generating procedure (\autoref{eq:wind_series}) in \autoref{fig:wind_generation_PSD} and it could be seen that the two are pretty similar.

\subsection{Aerodynamic}
The inputs of this block are the wind speed, the actual rotational speed, and the pitch angle while the outputs are the torque and power that the wind produces while spinning the rotor. \\
In the block the actual \acrshort{TSR} is firstly computed, then the power coefficient is extracted from the lookup table obtained from the \autoref{subsec:lookup_cp} and finally the rotor torque is obtained by dividing the rotor power (\autoref{eq:power}) by the rotor speed:
\begin{equation}
    T_R = \frac{P_R}{\omega_R} \ \ \left[\si{\newton\per\meter}\right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mechanical transmission}
In this simple simulation a mechanical transmission is not taken into account for what concerns the losses and the stiffness but a transmission ratio 
\begin{equation}
    n = \frac{\omega_{R}}{\omega_{G}} = \frac{1}{1}
    \label{eq:transmission_ratio}
\end{equation}
is considered in order to make the system more general introducing a transmission ratio, where $\omega_{R} \ \left[\si{\radian\per\second}\right]$ is the rotational speed on the rotor side while $\omega_{G} \ \left[\si{\radian\per\second}\right]$is the one on the generator side.\\
In this simulation the machine works as a direct drive.

\subsection{Dynamical equation}
The dynamical equation block solves the Newton's law written on the rotor side of the transmission:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      J_R \dot{\omega^R} = T_R^R - B_R\omega^R - T_T^R\\
      J_G \dot{\omega^G} = T_T^G - B_G\omega^G - T_G^G\\
      T_T^R\omega^R = T_T^G\omega^G\\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
This system of equation may be solved and finally the mechanical dynamic equation can be written on the rotor side:
\begin{gather}
    \left(J_R + \frac{J_G}{n^2}\right) \dot{\omega^R} = T_R^R - \frac{T_G^G}{n} - \left(B_R + \frac{B_G}{n^2}\right)\omega^R \\
    J_{eq} \dot{\omega^R} = T_R^R - T_G^R - B_{eq}\omega^R
    \label{eq:mech_eq}
\end{gather}
Where the subscription indicates if the quantity is referred to the rotor or to the generator, while the apex indicates the side of the transmission in which it is expressed.

\subsection{Transmission damping}
Finding information on the damping to be used in the \autoref{eq:mech_eq} is not simple because it is a parameter difficult to be identified via simulations only, and so real measurements would be necessary. Since a damping value is necessary to make the simulation more realistic (at least conceptually) then the system of equation in \autoref{eq:damping_sys} may be setted up to try to recover it. The former equation is the power balance between rotor and generator side of the transmission, while the latter is the torque balance.
\begin{gather}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\eta T_R^R \omega^{R} = T_G^G\omega^{G} \\
T_G^R =T_R^{R} - B_{eq}^R \omega^R
\end{aligned}
\right. ;
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
T_G^G\frac{\cancel{\omega^{R}}}{n}=\eta T_R^R \cancel{\omega^{R}} \\
\frac{T_G^G}{n}=T_R^R-B_{eq}^R\omega^R
\end{aligned}
\right. ;
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
T_G^G = \eta n T_R^R \\
\eta T_R^R\frac{\cancel{n}}{\cancel{n}} = T_R^R-B_{eq}^R\omega^R
\end{aligned}
\right. 
\label{eq:damping_sys}\\
B_{eq}^R= \frac{T_R^R}{\omega^R}(1 - \eta)= \frac{K_{opt}(\omega^R)^R}{\omega^R}(1 - \eta) = K_{opt}\omega^R(1 - \eta) \ \ \mesunt{\kilo\gram\square\meter}
\label{eq:damping}
\end{gather} 
where the coefficient $K_{opt}$ is a coefficient that will be later introduced in \autoref{subsec:torque_reference}, and has the units of $\mesunt{\newton \meter \square\second }$.\\
It could be noticed that, for a chosen value of efficiency $\eta$, then the damping in \autoref{eq:damping} depends on the rotational speed. Furthermore, it is also possible that the efficiency itself depends on the rotational speed, and so it is not possible to build a real map between these quantities with only the literature information at our disposal. To solve this problem, two assumptions are done. The first one is that the efficiency is not speed dependent and so only one value may be used as representative for all the operative conditions. In particular, the efficiency $\eta = 0.954$ is chosen, as proposed by \cite{Olimpo_Anaya‐Lara}. The second one is to consider the rated rotational speed. With these conditions in mind, the damping becomes:
\begin{equation}
  B_{eq}^R = K_{opt}\omega^R(1 - \eta) = 1.02\cdot10^7 1.014(1 - 0.954)=475.76 \cdot 10^3 \ \ \mesunt{\kilo\gram\square\meter}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Electrical generator}
As said before, nowadays the \acrfull{PMSM} are the most commonly employed machines, because they can operate in a range of speed, and so this kind of machine will be studied here.\\
According to the position of the magnets in the rotor, two families of \acrshort{PMSM} are defined. In particular, when the magnets are included inside the iron core, the rotor is no more symmetric from the magnetic point of view, and so the machine is called \textit{anisotropic}. On the other hand, when the magnets are mounted on the surface, the machine is called \textit{isotropic}. For studying the latter type, it is convenient to project the fundamental equations in a reference frame synchronous with the rotor, named \textit{dq frame}, in which the alternate electrical quantities of voltage and current are represented as their amplitude values. 
In this frame the equations of the machine are:
\begin{gather}
  0=u_d-Li_q\omega_{me}+L\frac{di_d}{dt}+Ri_d 
  \label{eq:d_axis_eq}\\
  \omega_{me}\Lambda_{mg}=u_q+Li_d\omega_{me}+L\frac{di_q}{dt}+Ri_q
  \label{eq:q_axis_eq}
\end{gather}
where $u_d$ and $u_q$ are the voltage of the d- and q-axis expressed in the dq frame (i.e. the peak value of the respectively quantities in the abc frame), $i_d$ and $i_q$ are the current in the dq frame (transformed in the same way as the the voltage), $\omega_{me}$ is the electro-mechanical speed of the rotor ($\omega_{me}=p\omega$), L is the inductance and R the resistance of the stator, $\Lambda_{mg}$ is the flux linkage of the permanent magnets, and p the number of pole pairs.\\
By multiplying both sides of \autoref{eq:q_axis_eq} by $i_q$, \autoref{eq:d_axis_eq} by $i_d$ and then summing them together is it possible to obtain the following power balance:
\begin{equation}
  p\omega\Lambda_{mg}i_q=u_di_d + u_qi_q+ L\left(i_d\frac{di_d}{dt} + i_q\frac{di_q}{dt}\right) + R(i_d^2 + i_q^2)
  \label{eq:gen_power_balance}
\end{equation}
then knowing that $i_d=0$ one can rewrite:
\begin{equation}
  \underbrace{p\omega\Lambda_{mg}i_q}_{Mech. IN} = \underbrace{u_qi_q}_{Elec. OUT}+ \underbrace{L i_q\frac{di_q}{dt}}_{Inductance} + \underbrace{Ri_q^2}_{Joule}
  \label{eq:gen_power_balance2}
\end{equation}
Since the power is not invariant in the transformation from the abc frame to the dq but $P_{dq} = \frac{3}{2}P_{abc}$, \autoref{eq:gen_power_balance2} has to be rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
  P_G = T_G\omega = \frac{3}{2}p\omega\Lambda_{mg}i_q = \frac{3}{2}u_qi_q + \frac{3}{2}L i_q\frac{di_q}{dt} + \frac{3}{2}R i_q^2
  \label{eq:gen_power_balance3}
\end{equation}
The choice of this frame makes the system of equations describing the generator linear, so the two axis can be controlled as two separated \acrfull{SISO} systems. In particular, the torque control is achieved by regulating the current of the q-axis, and letting the controller of the d-axis ensuring $i_d=0$.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\input{d_pmsm.tex}
\caption{Block diagram of the q-axis of a PMSM}
\label{fig:PMSM}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:PMSM} represents the block diagram of the q-axis of a \acrshort{PMSM}. $R_{iq}$ is the controller, $\uptau_{c}$ $\left[\si{\second}\right]$ is the time delay of the electrical converter, $T_R \ \left[\si{\newton \per \meter}\right]$ is the rotor imposed by the wind on the rotor.\\
It could be seen that the aerodynamical torque enters as a disturb in the block diagram. This model is not a description of the real behaviour of the \acrshort{WT}, because the $T_R$ is affected by the $\Omega_G$, and so in principle some sort of interaction between these quantities should have been introduced. Unfortunately, this dependency is not linear, implying that it is not possible to find a transfer function between them, and furthermore (and more important from the theoretical point of view) that the Laplace domain techniques are not valid any more. This problem may be solved observing that this mechanical dynamic evolves slowly compared to the electrical one, and so the electrical part sees the slowly varying dynamic as an almost-constant disturb. Finally for the sake of completeness, it must be remembered that the interactions between rotational speed and aero torque is taken into account into the aerodynamical block of the simulation. \\

 Obtaining the electrical parameters of commercial generators is not an easy task because they are protected by the manufacturers. For this reason, the values used by \cite{10-MW_Direct-Drive_PMSG-Based_Wind_Energy_Conversion_System_Model} and reported in \autoref{tab:generator_parameter} are used in this simulation.

 Once the inverter switching frequency is defined \textcolor{red}{add some reference justifying the choice}, then we can base on it the definition of the $\uptau_c$ and bandpass frequency. As described in \autoref{subsec:PMSM_control}, the time delay introduced by it in the response (i.e. the one used in the $G_c=\frac{1}{1+s\uptau_c}$ block of \autoref{fig:d_torque_control}) may be computed as half the switching period:
 \begin{gather}
 \uptau_{c}=\frac{\frac{1}{f_{inverter}}}{2}=\frac{\frac{1}{1000}}{2}=500 \ \ \mesunt{\micro \second}
 \end{gather}

 For its simplicity the chosen controller is a \acrshort{PID} one, and the design method exposed in \autoref{sec:e_pid_tuning} is used on the open loop function $G(s) = G_c(s)Y_{iq}(s)$, after having specified the crossover frequency of $\omega_{cp}=$1500 $\mesunt{\radian\per\second}$, which is less than $\frac{1}{4}$ the switching one. This design choice is intended to limit the maximum changing rate of the control signal that may be followed by the controller. Moreover, to avoid the propagation of the high frequency dynamics, a further pole is added at a frequency one decade greater than the crossover one. \\
 The tuning of the PID controller has been done following the procedures described in the \autoref{sec:e_pid_tuning}, but the proportional gain has been halved to have a better transient response. The resulting gains ($k_p$, $k_i$, $k_d$), the frequency of the added pole and the phase margin $\varphi$ are reported in \autoref{tab:tab_pid_tuning} alongside the same values computed from the Matlab frequency \textit{pidtune}, that may be used to have at least the order of magnitude of the expected values.

 The Bode diagram of the open loop system without any controller (i.e. taking into account the shaft mechanical dynamic, the generator's electrical dynamic, and the inverter time delay), the open loop system with the controller and the controller itself are reported in \autoref{fig:fig_bode_generator}. The bode plot of the close loop is shown in \autoref{fig:fig_bode_cl}. Given G(s) the direct transfer function (i.e. from input to output) and H(s) the feedback one, then the close loop transfer function is given by:
 \begin{gather}
     G_{CL}=\frac{G(s)H(s)}{1+G(s)H(s)}=\frac{R_{iq}(s)G_c(s)Y_{iq}(s)}{1+R_{iq}(s)G_c(s)Y_{iq}(s)}
     \label{eq:close_loop_TF}
 \end{gather}
 where $R_{iq}(s)$, $G_c(s)$, $Y_{iq}(s)$, have the meaning of \autoref{subsec:PMSM_control}, and $H(s)=1$ since there is no transfer function on the feedback line.

 \end{figure}

Furthermore, the response of the close loop system to a torque step input is reported in \autoref{fig:step_response}. It could be seen that the integral actions drives the steady state error to 0, while the produced overshoot is quite limited (around 4\%).

It is possible to derive the steady state power curve for the chosen generator starting from \autoref{eq:gen_power_balance3} and considering that the time derivative are null. The steady state current and voltage can be found thanks to \autoref{eq:q_axis_eq}. The powers as function of the \acrshort{WS} are reported in \autoref{fig:fig_static_electro_power}, considering both a unit or lower efficiency.

 \subsection{Pitch actuation}
In order to model the dynamic of the mechanical pitch actuators, two main effects have to be taken into account. The first one is the transfer function delaying the real response compared to the command action, while the second one is the maximum pitching rate. \\
The simplest mechanical model have a first order dynamic, as suggested by \cite{Olimpo_Anaya‐Lara} :
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\beta}{\hat{\beta}}=\frac{\omega_p^2}{s^2+2\zeta_p\omega_p s+\omega_p^2}
    \label{eq:beta_TF}
\end{equation}
with $\zeta_p=0.7$ and $\omega_p=2\pi \left[\si{\radian}\right]$.\\
The maximum pitching rate is reported to be $\pm 9 \left[\si{\degree\per\second}\right]$ in \cite{Olimpo_Anaya‐Lara}, and $\pm 10 \left[\si{\degree\per\second}\right]$ in \cite{Aerodynamics_of_wind_turbines} and \cite{DTU_Wind_Energy_Report-I-0092}. In this simulation, a rate limiter block with threshold at $\pm 10 \left[\si{\degree\per\second}\right]$ is placed after the actuation block. 

This model is based on the one presented in the \autoref{sec:c_basic_model_model} but with a modification on the synthesis of the generator torque reference. In particular, following what is presented in \cite{Olimpo_Anaya‐Lara}, an intermediate block with a \acrshort{PI} controller uses the error between the reference generator power and the actual one to set the generator torque. The control schema is presented in \autoref{fig:d_torque_control_2}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \input{d_torque_control_2.tex}
    \caption{Scheme of the implemented active power torque controller}
    \label{fig:d_torque_control_2}
\end{figure}

The saturation block constraints the reference power in between $P_g^* \in \left[0, P_{rated}\right]$.
The values of the gains are $k_i = 5.5$ and $k_p=0.5$, according to what is proposed by \cite{Olimpo_Anaya‐Lara}. The integral action is chosen to be so high to track the power commands, while the proportional gain helps to keep command and output in phase, at the cost of amplifying the high frequency part of the control signal.
